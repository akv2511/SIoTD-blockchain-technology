# SIoTD-blockchain-technology
In this project, I demonstrated that the simulated IoT device (SIoTD) is resilient to man-in-the-middle attack, denial of service, and other rogue attacks using blockchain technology and asymmetric encryption. I performed a programming implementation of blockchain based technology for Internet of Things (IoT) devices using PHP, Python and Ionic framework. I designed and developed a control Ionic application to interact with the simulated IoT devices
